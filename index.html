Your unwavering emotional support has been a guiding light, helping me navigate through both joyous moments and challenging times.</p>
            <p>Your kindness, empathy, and understanding have made a profound impact on my life, and I am truly blessed to have you as a friend. Your ability to provide comfort and encouragement has been a source of strength, and I can't thank you enough for being there, always.</p>
            <p>As you celebrate another year of life, I wish you boundless happiness, genuine smiles, and a heart full of the same warmth you've shared with me. May this year bring you all the love and joy you've selflessly given to others.</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, dear friend! May your day be as extraordinary as the support you've given me.</p>
            <p>With heartfelt appreciation and warmest wishes,</p>
